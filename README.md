# Image-processing-model
 This report is on image processing .
. Introduction
This report is on image processing .The purpose of this project are divided by some groups:
1>Extract image frames from each video.
2>Move Images from one folder to another.
3>Create a image processing model. 

.Tools and Technology 
1>Annaconda
2>Jupyter Notebook
.Description
First download the vedio zip file then extract .
Start vedio and with the help of sniffning tool we have to take some images.
Upload the file on Anaconda.
Start python2.7 environment and write code.
Load some pacakages like keras, cv2, matplotlib, pandas, numpy.
Create the variables and shuffle datasets randomly.
Import image plotting module and plot some images.
Lets declare some dimension and color.
Read and process the image in module.
we read our images one after the other and resize them with the cv2 commands.
We append 1 to y if the image is a p and 0 if it is a q.
Plot  the images with different color and label.
